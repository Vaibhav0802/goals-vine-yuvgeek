[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9fe8f795-32e2-46ae-9b19-878271506000/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/goals-vine/deploys)

Are you one of them who sets a New Year resolution (or) any goals at the beginning of the year but you don't follow it after?

Then this is the app for you.

## Idea behind Goals Vine

People set goals to achieve things.  But, we tend to lose focus of most of the goals for some reason. So, I did a mini-survey with some close people to understand other's perspectives on why people lose focus after setting goals & how we can solve them.

### Problems

These are key problems identified from the survey:

1. Forgetting the goals due to busy life.
2. No Motivation to continue.
3. No way to Measure our goals.

### Solutions

These are the suggestion received from the survey to solve those problems:

1. Send a reminder mail every month to remember their goals.
2. Send Motivational quotes & images in reminder mail to continue their progress.
3. Offer statistics to show their growth.
4. Categorize the goals to know how much one is achieving or lagging in a specific category.
5. Shows Leader board to compete with others.

This made to create **Goals Vine**.

## UI/UX 🖌️

Utilized Material Design throughout the application to follow the industry standards.

## Code Quality 👮‍♂️

Used Prettier, ESlint & TypeScript to improve the code quality. Followed best coding standards set by Angular. Used RxJS for reactive programming!

In a team, each developer uses a different coding environment. Some might use VS Code, others might use Vim. VSCode offers Prettier, ESLint extensions which helps them to fix the issues while coding itself.

But, what if a new member joined a team and committed the code in a different coding environment with the files are not formatted or not followed ESLint rules?

To avoid those, I've introduced a pre-commit hook with husky + lint-staged + prettier + eslint. 

What it does is, whenever you commit the code with `git commit` or any tool, it will automatically format it based on prettier configuration & runs the eslint only on the committed files. This helps the team to be aligned in the same coding formats. 

You can see the below image. I committed files for designing the home page. It runs prettier to format the code & after that it runs ESLint to ensure Code Quality.

[Lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) - Run linters against staged git files and don't let 💩 slip into your codebase!

[Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) - Husky improves your commits and more 🐶 woof!

## Killer feature

One killer feature in the app is, even if you are away from the App, you will get an email from **Goals Vine** to remind you about your goals. It will have motivational quotes & Images.

This email will be triggered to every user each month with their goal stats.

## Application Details 📖

**URL:** https://goals-vine.netlify.app/

**Github Repo:** https://github.com/Vaibhav0802/goals-vine-yuvgeek.git


## Challenges Faced 🤼

**Problem**: There is no `npm` package to integrate `Clerk` with the `Angular` framework. It has direct support only for React. Managing the Clerk with Angular is a tedious task. It took ~20% of the development effort. 

**Solution**: I completed the Clerk Integration with the help of @[Matej Bošnjak](@mbosnjak) & the Clerk team in the discord channel. Thanks to them.

---

**Problem**: Since I'm using the `Netlify function` for interacting with my `HarperDB`, I must return the API response within 10 seconds due to the time limit set by Netlify. Otherwise, my API will fail.

**Solution**: Considering the time-limit problem, I had to write my API & query in an optimized way to solve it.

---
**Problem**: To calculate the Leader board, I need to pull all the users from the `Clerk` database and simultaneously I need to query the goals with my `HarperDB`. Until today, I wasn't sure if there was a way to pull other user details from the Clerk.

**Solution**: With the help of the `Clerk` discord channel, I got the Postman collection for Clerk Backend API to interact with the database.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed working on this App. Thanks to Clerk & Hashnode for pushing us to do many innovative apps. I created Cover Pic within 5 minutes in the `Slickr` app. Thanks to @[Savio Martin](@saviomartin).
